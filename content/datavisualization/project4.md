<p><strong>An analysis of driving times to abortion clinics in the US.</strong></br>
<em>Summer 2017</em></br>
<em>The Pudding, in conjunction with Russel Goldberg and Amber Thomas</em></p>

Catalyzed work on this impactful essay, conducted weeks of background research to grasp such a complex and controversial topic, reached out and interviewed experts in the field, manually created complete datasets of abortion clinics locations and procedures in 12 states, and teamed up Russell Goldberg and Amber Thomas of The Pudding to complete the dataset. Provided advising as needed post-internship in September, until the article was published.
