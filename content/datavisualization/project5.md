<p><em>Summer 2017</em></br>
<em>The Pudding, in conjunction with Russell Goldenberg</em></p>

Pinpointed an interesting topic in pop culture, created a dataset through web scraping in Python, worked with the database in SQL, drew interesting conclusions, programmed a Markov Chain text simulator, conducted sentiment analysis on large swaths of text data, mocked up design ideas, and worked with Russell Goldenberg of The Pudding to make the graphics come to life.
