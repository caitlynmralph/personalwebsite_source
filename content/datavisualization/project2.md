* Coded a new algorithm for a more descriptive temporal analysis of fMRI images in the resting-state.
* The goal was to write a method that provided researchers more information than traditional analysis methods, such as Independent Component Analysis, currently tell us about neuroimages.
* Also programmed a way to visualize the results of this analysis algorithm as clearly and descriptively as possible.
* Presented findings to staff at the Mind Research Network and the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute.
